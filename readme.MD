## INTRODUCTION

This is a Mini Project done as a part of lab component "UIT2412 - Digital Systems and Microprocessor Laboratory" during the fourth semester.

## OBJECTIVE

The objective of this project is to design and implement a automated light intensity control system using Arduino, a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR), and an LED. The system aims to adjust the brightness of an LED based on the ambient light levels detected by the LDR. This project demonstrates the use of analog input, data mapping, and PWM output to create a responsive lighting solution that can be used in various applications such as energy-saving lighting systems, adaptive illumination in smart homes, and educational purposes to teach basic principles of electronics and programming. 

## MOTIVATION

An Automated Light Intensity Control System is essential for several practical reasons. Firstly, it enhances energy efficiency by adjusting lighting based on ambient conditions, thereby reducing electricity usage and costs. Secondly, it improves user convenience by ensuring optimal lighting levels without manual intervention, enhancing comfort and productivity in homes, offices, and public spaces. Additionally, such a system integrates seamlessly with smart home and building automation technologies, offering advanced control and efficiency. Its educational value lies in providing hands-on learning opportunities for electronics and programming, while its contribution to sustainability aligns with global efforts to minimize environmental impact through efficient energy management.

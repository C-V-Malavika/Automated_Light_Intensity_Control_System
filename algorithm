ALGORITHM

1. Setup Phase: 

    a. Initialize serial communication at 9600 baud rates. 
    b. Set the ldrPin as an input. 
    c. Set the ledPin as an output. 

2. Main Loop: 

    a. Read the value from the light-dependent resistor (LDR) connected to ldrPin. 
    b. Map the LDR value from the range [50, 300] to the range [255, 0] to determine LED brightness. 
    c. Constrain the brightness value to be within [0, 255]. 
    d. Write the constrained brightness value to the ledPin to control LED intensity. 
    e. Wait for 10 milliseconds before repeating the loop.
